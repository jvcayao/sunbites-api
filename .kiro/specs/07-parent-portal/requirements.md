# Spec 07 — Parent Portal

## Overview

The Parent Portal lives at `portal.sunbites.com.ph` (production) and `localhost:3001` (local). It is a separate Next.js application (`~/sunbites-portal`) for parents to monitor their child's canteen activity, wallet balance, and communicate with the canteen. Parents authenticate separately from kitchen staff, using a dedicated Sanctum token endpoint that issues tokens with the `parent` ability.

Parent accounts are **provisioned automatically at enrollment** — there is no self-registration. When a guardian is enrolled with an email address, the system creates their account and emails them an activation link. The parent sets their password via that link before their first login.

---

## Authentication

### Token-Based Auth (Sanctum)
- Parent login: `POST /api/v1/portal/auth/login` — returns a Sanctum token with `parent` ability
- Parent logout: `POST /api/v1/portal/auth/logout` — revokes token
- Forgot password: `POST /api/v1/portal/auth/forgot-password` — always returns the same generic response regardless of email existence (prevents account enumeration); sends the appropriate email server-side (activation if not yet activated, password reset if already activated)
- Reset password / Activate: `POST /api/v1/portal/auth/reset-password` — shared endpoint for both initial activation and subsequent password resets
- All portal API routes are protected by `auth:sanctum` + `ability:parent` middleware

### Token Storage
- Parent token stored in Zustand memory only — never `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
- `~/sunbites-portal` Zustand auth store holds the token; the API client reads it and attaches `Authorization: Bearer {token}` to every request

### Rate Limiting
- Login and forgot-password endpoints: max 5 attempts per 5 minutes per IP

### Parents Table
```
parents
  id
  first_name         (string)
  last_name          (string)
  email              (string, unique)
  password           (string, nullable — null until activated)
  phone              (string, nullable)
  address            (string, nullable)
  profile_photo_path (string, nullable)
  email_verified_at  (timestamp, nullable — null = not yet activated; set on first password set)
  remember_token     (string, nullable)
  created_at, updated_at
```

`email_verified_at` serves as the activation flag. An account with `email_verified_at = null` is provisioned but not yet activated — the parent cannot log in.

---

## Account Provisioning (via Enrollment)

Parent accounts are created by the system during enrollment or when a guardian contact with an email is added from the student's Contacts tab in the POS app. See Spec 05 for the full provisioning flow.

### Activation Flow
1. Parent receives `ParentWelcomeMail` with a signed activation link (uses Laravel `PasswordBroker` token, expires in 60 minutes)
2. Link opens: `portal.sunbites.com.ph/activate?token=...&email=...`
3. Parent sets a new password (min 8 chars, confirmed)
4. On submit: `POST /api/v1/portal/auth/reset-password` — sets password, sets `email_verified_at = now()`
5. Redirect to login page with success toast: "Account activated! You can now log in."

### Forgot Password (Pre-Activation)
- If a parent tries to log in before activating: return 401 with error `account_not_activated`
- Portal login page shows: "Your account has not been activated yet. Check your email for the activation link, or contact the canteen to resend it."
- Forgot-password link on portal: always returns generic "If an account exists, we'll send an email." Server sends the activation email (not a regular reset) if `email_verified_at` is null.

### Resend Activation (POS)
- Kitchen staff can resend the activation email from: Student detail → Contacts tab → `[Resend Activation Email]`
- Only available when the parent account has `email_verified_at = null`
- Rate-limited: max 3 resends per guardian per 24 hours (server-side)
- See Spec 05 for the API endpoint

---

## Parent Profile

Accessible at: `portal.sunbites.com.ph/profile`

### Editable Fields
- First name, Last name
- Phone number
- Address
- Profile photo upload — MIME whitelist: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp` only; max 2MB; server-side validation
- Password change (current password required) — via a **dedicated** `POST /api/v1/portal/profile/change-password` endpoint; not mixed into the profile PATCH

### Profile Photo Storage & Serving
- Photos are stored on the **public** disk under `photos/parents/`
- The API returns `profile_photo_url` — a fully-qualified public URL (e.g. `https://api.sunbites.com.ph/storage/photos/parents/abc.jpg`) — not a raw file path
- The portal renders this URL directly in `<Image src={profile.profile_photo_url} />`
- `profile_photo_path` (raw path) must never be returned to the frontend; the controller resolves it to a URL before returning

---

## Linked Students

A parent can be linked to multiple students (e.g. siblings enrolled at the same canteen). Links are established automatically at enrollment or when a contact is added in the POS Contacts tab. There is no manual link-request flow.

### parent_student (pivot table)
```
parent_student
  id
  parent_id                (FK → parents)
  student_id               (FK → students)
  linked_at                (timestamp)
  linked_by                (FK → users — the staff member who enrolled/added the contact)
  wallet_alert_threshold   (decimal, default 0)

  UNIQUE KEY: (parent_id, student_id)
```

### One-to-Many: 1 Parent → Many Students
- A parent can be linked to multiple students (siblings)
- A student is linked based on the guardian contacts registered at enrollment or added via the Contacts tab
- Multiple contacts on one student may share the same parent email — only one `parent_student` pivot row is created (idempotent)

---

## Parent Dashboard

Accessible at: `portal.sunbites.com.ph/dashboard`

### When No Students Are Linked
- Informational card: "Your account is set up but no students are linked yet. Please contact the canteen if you believe this is an error."
- No self-service linking available

### When Students Are Linked
- Student selector (tabs or dropdown) if multiple students linked
- Per-student dashboard showing:

#### Outstanding Credit Alert
- Shown only when `student.credit_balance > 0`
- Warning card: `bg-red-50 border-red-300` — "Your child has an outstanding canteen credit of ₱X. Please settle with the canteen."
- Displayed above the wallet card

#### Wallet Card
- Current wallet balance (large, prominent)
- Last top-up date and amount
- Quick view of last 5 transactions
- "Set Alert Threshold" link

#### Spending Summary Cards
- Today's total spent
- This week's total spent
- This month's total spent

#### Recent Purchases (today)
- List of items purchased today with time and amount

---

## Child Activity Tracking

### Authorization (IDOR Prevention)
All student-scoped routes (`/api/v1/portal/students/{id}/activity`, `/api/v1/portal/students/{id}/wallet`) must verify **before returning any data** that a confirmed `parent_student` link exists between the currently authenticated parent and the `{id}` in the URL. If no link exists, return 403 — never return data based on URL parameter alone.

Implemented via `ParentStudentPolicy::view()` checked on every student-scoped portal endpoint.

### Per-Student Spending Breakdown

#### Filters
- Date range: Today / This Week / This Month / Custom Range
- View: By Day / By Week / By Month

#### Table View
Columns: Date, Item Purchased, Quantity, Amount, Running Balance

#### Summary Panel
- Total spent in selected period
- Number of visits (unique order days)
- Most purchased item
- Average spend per day

---

## Wallet Tracking

### Wallet Balance Card
- Current balance
- Total topped up (all time)
- Total spent (all time)

### Transaction History Table
Columns: Date, Type (Credit / Debit), Amount, Balance After, Note/Reference

### Wallet Alert Setting
- Parent can set a minimum balance threshold per linked student
- When wallet balance drops below threshold at POS withdrawal, a queued email job is dispatched (`WalletAlertJob`)
- Default threshold: ₱0 (no alert)
- Stored on `parent_student` pivot: `wallet_alert_threshold`
- **Ownership validation required:** endpoint that updates `wallet_alert_threshold` must verify via `ParentStudentPolicy` that the authenticated parent owns the `parent_student` link — never accept a raw `parent_student_id` from the client without policy check

---

## Meal Planner (Read-Only)

Accessible at: `portal.sunbites.com.ph/meal-plan`

Parents view the canteen's weekly meal schedule. Same data managed by kitchen staff in Spec 04 — read-only.

### Layout
- **Month tabs**: pill buttons for all 10 school months explicitly shown in order — Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar. Horizontally scrollable on mobile. Active month highlighted with primary color fill.
- **Week tabs**: Week 1 / Week 2 / Week 3 / Week 4
- **Meal grid**: rows = Monday–Friday; columns = Day, Ulam, Vegetables, Fruit, Soup, Snacks (all 5 always shown)
  - All cells rendered as plain text (no inputs)
  - Empty cells shown as "—"
- **Unpublished week**: when the canteen has not published the selected week (`visible_to_parents = false`), show an informational card — "Meal plan for this week is not yet available." — in place of the table
- No Save, Reset, or visibility toggle controls visible

### Branch Scoping
- Branch derived from the parent's linked student's branch
- If a parent has students in multiple branches, show a branch selector above the month tabs

---

## Feedback System

Accessible at: `portal.sunbites.com.ph/feedback`

### Feedback Form
- Rating (1–5 stars)
- Category: Food Quality / Service / Portion Size / Cleanliness / General
- Message (textarea, optional) — sanitized server-side with `strip_tags()` before storage
- Student selector (which child this is about, optional)

### Feedback Table
```
feedbacks
  id
  parent_id        (FK → parents)
  student_id       (FK → students, nullable)

- Filter by rating, category, date, read/unread

---

## Parent Management Page (POS App)

Accessible at: `pos.sunbites.com.ph/references/parents`, roles: Admin, Manager, Supervisor.

This page gives kitchen staff a full view of all parent accounts and their linked children, without needing to navigate per-student.

### Parent List
- Table columns: Name, Email, Activation Status (`Activated` / `Pending`), Linked Students (count + names), Registered Date, Last Login
- Filter by: activation status, branch (filters parents whose students belong to the branch)
- Search by parent name or email
- Default sort: registered date descending

### Parent Detail (drawer or page)
- Parent profile info: name, email, phone, address, activation status
- **Linked Students** list: each linked student shown as a card with name, grade, branch, and a link to the student detail page
- **Actions:**
  - `Resend Activation Email` — visible only when `email_verified_at` is null; rate-limited max 3 per 24 hours
  - `Send Password Reset Email` — visible only when `email_verified_at` is not null

### No Delete / Edit from This Page
- Parent accounts are not deleted from this page; they are unlinked from a student via the student's Contacts tab
- Parent profile info (name, email) is not editable from this page; parents edit their own profile from the portal
